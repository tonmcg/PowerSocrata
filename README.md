PowerSocrata
==============
PowerSocrata is a series of functions that enable users to connect to and access data in Power BI and Excel from the Socrata open data portals, including the [Socrata Open Data API (SoDA)](https://dev.socrata.com/) and the Socrata "human-friendly" URLs.

PowerSocrata is created using the [M language](https://msdn.microsoft.com/query-bi/m/power-query-m-reference), the same language used by the Power Query user experience found in Power BI Desktop and Excel 2016.
